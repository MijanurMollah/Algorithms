# Algorithms<br>

##Lab1 <br>
Implemented Selection Sort and Merge Sort
Implemented a Modified Merge Sort where Selection Sort called within Merge Sort

##Lab2 <br>
Provided two different implementations of pow, one in linear time and the otherr in lg n time
Modified pow so x can be float and y can be negative

##Lab3 <br>
Provided an implementation of a function that multiplies 2 numbers digit by digit (multiply4)
that runs in O(N^2) time, and another function using Karatsuba’s algorithm (multiply3) that runs in ≈ O(N1.585)
time.

##Lab4 <br>
Given an graph, wrote an algorithm to find minimum spanning tree of the graph

##Lab5 <br>
You are in charge of running a motel that has N rooms. You receive requests for bookings in
batches in the format given below. Your algorithm should return “1” if you are able to accommodate 
the set of bookings, and “0” if N rooms are insufficient to accommodate the bookings

##Lab6 <br>
You are carrying a backpack that can only hold a limited amount of weight. Journeying through
a cave you discover a pile of hidden treasure. Unfortunately, you can’t carry it all with you.
Select the items that have the greatest value such that the items you choose don’t exceed a
